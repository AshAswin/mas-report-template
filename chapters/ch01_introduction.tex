    \section{Motivation}
    Deep Neural Network models are increasingly becoming a part of many Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems for safety-critical applications, such as Autonomous Driving(AD). However, their tendency to make over-confident and false predictions raises concerns on functional safety of their host systems. One of the ways in which the Deep Learning(DL) research community tries to solve this problem is by devising methods that estimate uncertainties(inversely confidences) associated with predictions of Neural Network(NN) models. The confidence estimates are then utilized by the host AI systems to selectively pick or reject predictions (also called as selective prediction). A considerable amount of research conducted on this topic has been attributed to methods that estimate uncertainties of Neural Network models for classification and only relatively fewer works focus on approaches for regression nets. There arises the need to enhance the existing or devise better uncertainty estimation methods suited for Neural Net models performing regression tasks. Also, there does not exist a comprehensive benchmark for such class of uncertainty estimation methods, which would reveal potential methods for the DL research community to conduct further research. This work compensates the need for such a benchmark which performs a detailed comparative evaluation of uncertainty estimation methods for regression nets.
